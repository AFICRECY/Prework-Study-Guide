# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

I created a website that can organize and explain what all we learned in our Prework-Study Guide. It is easier to understand all of the topics covered when they are displayed in a way that is visually pleasing and also catgeorized with the intent of reviewing and studying from it later. Using VS Code, the Command Line Interface, and GitHub, I was able to structure a webpage that described some of the notes from our HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git. I learned all new Javascript commands, which showed me how to create more than a static webpage with just HTML and some CSS. 


## Installation

N/A 


## Usage

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
